# 5.0.0 PegasOS Team

Apart from wrapping up final administrative content, we’d like to use this section for a few things: for one, we’d like to use it as a thank-you wall for the people in and outside of this project that made it all possible. For two, we’d like to use it to tell you a little bit about ourselves, discuss how we felt about the project while developing and researching it, how we feel about the final state of the project, and what our plans are for the future.


As the project lead and sponsor, I can say that it’s been a real pleasure working with all of you on the PegasOS team. This certainly wasn’t an easy project, and even more so was this not an easy year! I’m sure that none of us will be able to forget 2020, and I know that for me at least, the time spent on this project with you all - through all the meetings and restarting and the endless amounts of documentation that we’ve been writing - I’ve enjoyed all of it and you all have been great to work with. I wish you the best in your future endeavors, and I hope that this project gave you valuable experience that you can take with you wherever you go. And I hope I wasn’t too bad of a project lead, hehe. Thanks again you guys, you’re awesome.

## 5.1.0 Administrative Content

There is not much to discuss here, so this section will remain short.


The total budget for PegasOS did not change from last semester, which has been included here for completeness.


***Project Budget***

| Item             | Price | Quantity | Total Price |
| ---------------- | ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| Raspberry Pi     |       |          |             |
| Micro HDMI Cable | $7    | 1        | $7          |
| Micro SD Card    | $9    | 1        | $9          |
| Raspberry Pi Kit | $75   | 3        | $225        |
|                  |       |          |             |
| Total            |       |          | $241        |


PegasOS still uses the GNU General Public License version 3 and later. To save space on this document, this license has been included in its entirety in the Spring 2020 Design Document in the Appendices section. A link to this license is also included here.


As the project has become half-development and half-research, we have made an effort to make as much documentation available and that it is easily navigated on our documentation GitHub, which is linked here. The source code for the OS is included here. The release of the project that coincides with this version of the documentation and is the submission of the project for Fall 2020 is here.


The documentation includes all original designs, plans, and research from the Spring semester, summer, and Fall semester. As it should be plain to see, these original designs do not reflect the entirety of the system in its current state, which is part of the reason why this is a separate document (as we discussed in Sections 0.1.1 and 0.1.2).

## 5.2.0 Closing Remarks

The following sections are for each member of the PegasOS Team to write a little bit about themselves, their time with the project, what their plans are for the future, and if they’d like to thank anybody that helped them along the way.

## 5.2.1 Kenny Alvarez

***Thank You’s***

I’d like to thank our leader Chris for pitching this project, for me it was the only interesting project that I saw as it was mostly web development and simulations on unity that were being presented. I think I learned a lot about system software and would like to get into more of it after I graduate. I would also like to thank my parents for supporting me for the last 2 years at UCF and the rest of the group for just being a great group of people to work with on this project.


***Who Am I?***

I’m Kenny Alvarez, I’m about to graduate in CS in December 2020. I was always into computers and creating games ever since I was a little kid but my parents at the time couldn’t afford a computer for me so I couldn’t get into it as much as I wished to.


***What did you think of PegasOS? As a project? The final result?***

I think that PegasOS was a difficult project that I was glad I was a part of and that it was great that we had a working OS. I knew nothing about making an OS so I thought it wouldn't be that difficult to learn how to make one but I was wrong, just trying to know what to do was already a difficult enough task so the fact we have a working OS was a great feeling.


***What’s next for you?***

I don’t exactly have that much planned for after I graduate. I original plan was to get into game development and try to work in a studio but after reading about that the job market is on the bad side, it is very competitive compared to other industries, and the working conditions for many studios are not good (seems like working 60+ hours a week is expected for most studios) so that turned me away from doing full-time game development so I’ll make games as side projects. After I’m done with classes I will be doing some personal projects to learn more skills while applying for software development jobs.

## 5.2.2 Jacqueline Godier

***Thank You’s***

I’d like to thank Chris Walen for pitching such an interesting topic. I feel like I’ve learned a lot from this experience that I can apply to future endeavors.


***Who Am I?***

I’m Jacqui, a Computer Science major at UCF. I have a lot of experience in game development, but have really wanted to branch into more low level topics. I also have an interest in Cyber Security, which I hope to learn more about after I commission into the USAF. 


***What did you think of PegasOS? As a project? The final result?***

I thought PegasOS was a great way to challenge myself in a subject I had been interested in for a long time. It was always a huge undertaking, but communicating with the team was always very easy and the progress we made always felt rewarding. 


***What’s next for you?***

I will be working fulltime as a software developer as I wait to enter the USAF. 

## 5.2.3 Giancarlo Guillen

***Thank You’s***

I'd like to first say thank you to Chris. Chris pitched the perfect project that showed that modern CS projects are not all about Web Development, so when he presented his idea to the class I knew I wanted to be a part of the team. I would also like to thank him for allowing us to work on this project and for him being open to our ideas. I'd also like to say thanks to my friends and family for helping me with support over these past four and a half years. 


***Who Am I?***

My name's Giancarlo, I am a graduating computer science major. I've always been intrigued by the background work of software and programs. I came to UCF to learn the skills and concepts to one day create innovative projects. 


***What did you think of PegasOS? As a project? The final result?***

I thought this was an amazing opportunity to be a part of creating the groundwork for future projects to come. I hope other senior design groups are able to contribute and make it a sound operating system in the future. I enjoyed the ups and downs of this project, because it gave me experience in the low levels of computer science. It really opened my eyes to how something can seem so simple but actually takes a lot of hard work to get it up and running.
I am very proud of my team and I for pouring our blood, sweat and tears to create PegasOS, I am overjoyed with the end result.


***What’s next for you?***

As a graduating student I hope that I can find opportunities that will help me expand what I have learned thus far. I'm currently applying to internships and jobs in the field. 

## 5.2.4 Jacob Thomas

***Thank You’s***

I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone on the team. You guys are definitely one of the best groups I ever had. It’s been a pleasure working with all of you and I wish you guys the best of luck.


***Who Am I?***

Hello! I’m Jacob Thomas and I’m a student who is graduating this December with a bachelor’s in computer science. Ever since I graduated high school, I always had an interest in computer programming. It is one of the reasons why I came to UCF. To help develop my skills further and to figure out my career.


***What did you think of PegasOS? As a project? The final result?***

When starting this project, I knew it was going to be a challenging project. When we were starting to prepare for this project did it make me realize how enormous of a project this really is. I definitely feel like we bit more than we can chew.
That being said though, PegasOS has definitely provided me new incitement on how operating systems worked. Even though we had to cut some stuff because of time constraints or lack of knowledge, I feel like we definitely showed something we can be proud of.


***What’s next for you?***

I don’t have much planned out honestly. I know I’m a little on that, but hey, got to start somewhere. Right now, I’m trying to find a job to help jump start my career. I like working in software development or low-level stuff so I hope I find something to fill that need. I’m also interested in maybe doing game development as well. Hopefully I can release my own video game one day.

## 5.2.5 Christopher Walen

***Thank You’s***
I’d like to thank the team again, without you guys this project wouldn’t have happened in the first place. It’s been such a great learning experience, and it's been a lot of fun getting to work with you guys and make this a reality.


I’d also like to thank my girlfriend, Hope. She’s helped me stay sane throughout college and especially my last two semesters at UCF, and her editor skills certainly helped us in the past! Thanks for all the late nights helping me and keeping me company, and all of the encouraging words you’ve given me over the years. I look forward to all the things that are coming in our life together.


***Who Am I?***
I’m Chris, I’m graduating this December with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. It’s been a wild and crazy ride getting here, but it’s all been a formative and greatly enlightening experience for me.


In the beginning I wasn’t quite sure what I wanted to do with the degree, all I knew was that I enjoyed programming. I came from Valencia with my Associate’s in Computer Science, and got to start right off the bat with classes that used everything I knew to the fullest. I struggled a lot and repeated a few classes, but I eventually started to ‘get it’. I attribute my CS enlightenment to Computer Science 2 with Szumlanski. That class challenged me like no other, but at the same time it was all making sense to me where other classes in the major just weren’t quite sticking yet. Ever since then I’ve actually felt like a real Computer Scientist and Software Developer, and it gave me a lot of confidence in knowing that I can actually do this.


As I’ve gotten further into my degree at UCF, I’ve gravitated more and more towards the systems side of Computer Science. There haven’t always been opportunities for me to explore this, but whether its been systems in Game Design and Development or a project as crazy as PegasOS, I’ve really been trying to get my feet wet in the world of Embedded and System development and I’ve found it really interesting, if not difficult! Now that I’m at the end of my degree, part of me is sad that it's over and that this project is over, but the other part of me is really excited to see where my life takes me and what cool projects I get to work on next. As long as it's something that challenges me to do my best and make interesting decisions, I’ll have a great time.


***What did you think of PegasOS? As a project? The final result?***
It’s been a bumpy road, that’s for sure! Though ambitious projects like this always seem to have bumpy roads, so what’s new? But I think PegasOS was a great opportunity for us to do something that was really different from what everyone else in the class was doing, and I think that we’ve come a long way and achieved a lot of what we set out to do. Sure it's sad that we couldn’t do everything that we had originally planned, but it's honestly amazing that we even have this much to show for it. OS development is hard, and I think it's safe to say we all learned that the hard way!


But PegasOS has been a great experience, for me at least, and I’m glad I got to meet these great people that all brought their A game to this project. Dealing with other classes on top of this wasn’t easy, but we pushed through and it's all been worth it in the end. I’m very happy with the state of the project, and I’m really hopeful that Senior Design or Operating System students after us can take this project and really make it their own. I’m glad I got up and pitched it that day back in January.


***What’s next for you?***
At the moment I’m not so sure; right now I’m looking for entry-level embedded system and system engineering jobs. I’m not the pickiest person in the world, so I’m not sure where I’ll end up quite yet. I’m applying for some positions at Lockheed Martin currently, so we’ll see how that goes! When I’m not working you’d probably find me either playing games or developing my own games - its a goal of mine to get a game I’ve made onto Steam some day! It could also be cool to work as a game developer, though that market is super competitive and I like the freedom of making whatever you want as an indie dev.
