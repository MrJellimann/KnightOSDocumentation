# Legacy Documentation

All old documentation that doesn't really have a place in the current design is going to get dumped and logged in here.

It should go without saying that none of what's in here is not reflective of the current PegasOS system, nor is it necessarily reflective of future iterations of the PegasOS system. Documentation is kept her for historical reasons, and to serve as a backlog of ideas for future expansion.
